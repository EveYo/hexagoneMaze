    * Traverses the board via dfs to generate the maze, updating and keeping

    * A. The length of the longest path to an edge in the maze

    * The algorithm goes as follows:
    * 1. Add the start_coord to the stack, and mark as visited
    * 2. While the stack is not empty do:

    *   a. Peek the top of the stack (call it curr_cell)
    *   c. Use chooseNeighbour to choose the neighbour to visit
    *   d. If the neighbour exists, for that neighbour (call it neigh_cell) do:

    *     i. Link curr_cell with neigh_cell
    *     ii. Set neigh_coord to be visited
    *     iii. Update the neigh_cell's path distance
    *     iv. If necessary, update length of longest path so far
    (longest_path_dist)
    *     v. Update the end coordinate only if its path distance to start is
    strictly greater
    *     vi. Push neigh_cell into the stack

    *   e. Otherwise (if chooseNeighbour returns nullptr), pop the stack.

    * @param start_coord The {q, r} coordinate of the start of the maze.
    * @param branch_prob Specifies how often it should "branch out" when
    choosing neighbours.
    *                    A small branch_prob means neighbours of the same radius
    (same dist from the centre) are preferred
    *                    A large branch_prob means neighbours of a different
    radius (diff dist from the centre) are preferred
